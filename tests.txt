clr:
  check if it's zero

copy:
  check value

div:
  create an array containing 1s, divide it by two, check result

ramp:
  ramp from 0 to 1 on the length of the buffer, check result

ramp:
  ramp from 0 to 1 with a multipler of 0.5, check result

mul:
  mul the buffer by two, check the result

add:
  add a buffer containing 1s to a buffer containing -1s, check zero

madd:
  add a buffer containing 2s with a mul of 0.5 to a buffer containing -1s, check
  zero

mean:
  do a ramp from 0 to 1, check the mean is 0.5

fill:
  fill with 1s, check the result

smul:
  get a buffer with 1s, mul every even value by 0

clip:
  get a buffer like so:
    2 * Math.sin(Math.PI * 2 * 440 * i / 44100), for i in 0 -> size

  clip in [-1; 1], check no values are outside the range
